**Why is measles so contagious?**

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to humans. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they release tiny droplets containing the virus that can remain in the air for up to 2 hours. If you're not immune and walk into a room where an infected person was, you have a 90% chance of getting sick!

**Key Concepts:**
- **Râ‚€ (Basic Reproduction Number)**: The average number of people one infected person will infect  
- **Herd Immunity**: When enough people are vaccinated to protect the whole community  
- **Attack Rate**: The percentage of susceptible people who get infected during an outbreak  
- **Quarantine vs Isolation**: Isolation separates sick people; quarantine separates those who might be sick
